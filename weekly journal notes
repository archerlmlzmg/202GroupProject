XP Core Values:
Communication(Ming Tang): We are using multiple ways to ensure the information transparency in our team, like face-to-face and online meetings, collaborative tools(waffle.io, Google doc, WebEx, github, etc) .In this week, we had one face to face meeting and three online meetings to make sure that everyone in this group understands our requirements, designs. During the meeting we use white boards and shared screens to give visual synchronization. Moreover, to persist our discussion, we took notes in a google doc which is shared with every member. In this way, any member can trace whatever we mentioned or decided before.

Simplicity(Xing Yang): We try to use the simplest way to found our greenfoot project. Use this as our code base.  We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We will refactor our code during the developing to make them more generalize,  easy to maintain and easy to extend to new features.

Feedback(Xinlei Yang): we commit many times in this week.Anyone takes every commitment seriously and we discuss our project design early and often then listen carefully to each other and make any changes needed. We will often talk about the project and adapt our process to it in this way, which should make our team productive.
   	
Courage(Sheng Zhou): In this week’s progress, each of us met some kind of challenges. Ming, one of our team member has the task to make new figures for our project. It is a time-consumer task and it is hard to start at beginning. Our project requires several types of figures with each has at least two poses. However, the rest of the team encourage Ming not to be worried a lot but start from the main character which is Bruce Lee. Now, with the explicit purpose, Ming feels better and have done some scratches of this main character. The rest of us focus on the basic setup for each character. We have assigned each people piece of work. Team members cheer others up and make big improvement for our project.

Respect(Minglu Liu): This week we had two discussion meetings, every team member provide ideas about how to implement their own design pattern and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member. Five of us all contribute value and respect the expertise of each other. Each team member has different responsibilities to accomplish their own task individually. No one thinks the others’ tasks are simple or easy or meaningless. We constantly encourage each team member to provide as many ideas as possible in a free way, then we take detailed notes and never judge each other, everyone feels respected and comfortable working on this team project. For example, this week we assigned each team member a different task, such as every team member will be responsible for one character design, four enemies and one main character as the Bruce Lee hero.
